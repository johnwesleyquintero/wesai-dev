# WesAI.Dev

**Your AI Co-pilot for the Web.**

WesAI.Dev is a developer's scratchpad for rapidly prototyping web components. Describe a UI element in plain English, and our AI partner—powered by Google's Gemini model—will generate a production-ready, self-contained React component with live preview.

Go from idea to interactive component in seconds.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language to Code:** Describe what you want, from a simple button to a complex dashboard widget.
- **Instant Live Preview:** See your generated component rendered in a secure sandbox, with full interactivity.
- **Production-Ready React:** Get clean, self-contained React (.tsx) code with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Developer-Focused UX:** A streamlined, resizable two-panel interface designed for maximum productivity.

## Getting Started

1.  **Describe:** In the input panel, describe the component you want to build.
    > _**Pro Tip:** Be specific! The more detail you provide, the better the result. Try: "A responsive pricing card with three tiers: Basic, Pro, and Enterprise. Each card should show the plan name, price, a list of features, and a CTA button. Highlight the Pro plan with a different border color."_

2.  **Generate:** Click the **Generate** button or use the `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` shortcut.

3.  **Review & Use:** Interact with your new component in the **Preview** tab. Switch to the **Code** tab to copy the .tsx code and drop it directly into your project.
